            Our group developed an app that calculates carbon emissions from transport to help individuals make informed decisions about their travel choices. 
            To find the nessesary data and statistics to calculate the emission, we used a carbon footprint analysis. This methodology involves calculating the total greenhouse gas emission associated with different transport alternatives. By using a carbon footprint analysis we can provide a comprehensive view of an individual's environmental impact, including indirect and direct emission.

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            Here is the methodology used for gathering data for the Carbon App. 
            The methodology is based on collecting real data on carbon emissions. 
            The students involved in this project have been thorough and have searched for scientifically-based data. 
            The development of the formulas used in the app was done by the students and is explained in detail. 
            Our aim with the Carbon App is to increase people's awareness of their daily carbon emissions and encourage them to take steps to reduce it.
