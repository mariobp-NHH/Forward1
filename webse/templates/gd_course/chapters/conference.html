                        In the midway conference, the students present their apps. We focus on four different points. <strong>First</strong>, we explain the design and the functionalities of our apps (user experience), we also explain the software architecture, and how that architecture is related to the design and the functionalities of our app. <strong>Second</strong>, we explain the methodology used to work out transport carbon emissions. <strong>Third</strong>, we explain the business model for our app. Which is our target group? How are we going to sell our app? Why our app is different, unique, and useful? <strong>Fourth</strong>, we explain the teamwork. Which is the role of each member of the team? Do those roles change within the project? Which is the strategy of the group to achieve the objectives? How to make the group more balanced and inclusive (gender, race, religion, sexual orientation)? How to make the group more diverse and use all the potential of the members? How to create an ecosystem that could help all the members to flourish and contribute to the group?
