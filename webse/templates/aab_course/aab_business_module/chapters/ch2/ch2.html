              In this chapter we study the main characteristics of <strong>electricity markets</strong>. We study the main characteristics of those markets that 
              make them special in different dimensions. We study the reasons because companies can exercise <strong>market power</strong> in those markets. 
              We analyze the design of <strong>electricity markets in Europe</strong>, and also the design of those markets in smaller markets, i.e., 
              the <strong>distribution sector</strong>. We focus our attention on the role of digitalization in electricity markets, paying special attention to 
              the business model implemented by the<strong> Norwegian company NODES</strong> that uses digitalization to increase flexibility in distribution electricity markets.

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The objective of this section is to provide a general <strong>overview</strong> of the restructuring process of
        electricity markets that has taken place in the last years. Electricity markets have been liberalized in the last two decades. In this section we study four papers that analyse that process in
        detail. Those papers have been written for prominent researchers that has been involve in the
        liberalization process of electricity markets in Europe and United States.
        <br>
        <br>
        Based on those papers, we could identify the main problems in the restructuring process, and
        how we could use those lessons to analyse the current challenges in electricity markets.
        <br>
        <br>
        The authors analyse the restructuring process using different approaches, however there are
        many ideas that appear recursively in the papers. Try to identify those key aspects and try to
        think how those main aspects affect other utilities rather than electricity.

        Journal of Economic Perspectives, 16, 1, 191-211.</h4>
        <p>Please read the paper. Below, we address some questions that cover the main topics in the paper:</p>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="boxa" style="background: #49736f;">
        <h5 style="text-align:center;">Question 1:</h5>
        <p>
          Which are the <strong>characteristics of electricity markets</strong> that facilitate the exercise
          of market power?
          <ul>
            <li>Demand is difficult to <strong>forecast</strong>.</li>
            <li>Demand is <strong>insensitive</strong> to price fluctuations.</li>
            <li>Supply faces <strong>binding constraints</strong> at peak times.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage</strong> is prohibitively costly.</li>
            <li>Demand and supply have to <strong>match</strong> all the time.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
    </div> 
    <div class="boxa">
        <h5 style="text-align:center;">Question 2:</h5>
        <p>
          Which are the <strong>market designs</strong> proposed by Borenstein to mitigate market power
          in electricity markets?
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Long-term contracts</strong> between wholesale buyers and sellers.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-time retail pricing</strong> of electricity, which indicates to the final consumer on an hourly
              basis when electricity is more or less costly to consume.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
    </div>               
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="boxa" style="background: #49736f;">
        <h5 style="text-align:center;">Question 3:</h5>
        <p>
          Which is the role of<strong> long-term contracting</strong> in electricity markets? How <strong>long-term
            contracting</strong> could contribute to mitigate market power?
          <ul>
            <li>When a firm has sold some output in advance, it has <strong>less incentive to restrict its output</strong>
              in the spot market in an attempt to push up prices in that market, since it does not receive
              the higher spot price on the output it has already sold through a forward contract.</li>
              <li>
                The incentive of a generating company to exercise market power will depend on its <strong>net
                  purchasing position</strong> in the market at a given point in time.
                  <ul>
                    <li>If a firm were a large <strong>net seller</strong>, it would likely have an incentive to restrict output
                      to raise price.</li>
                      <li>
                        If it had sold much of its output under forward contracts,then it would have much
		                    less incentive to restrict its output to increase the spot price.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
    </div> 
    <div class="boxa">
        <h5 style="text-align:center;">Question 4:</h5>
        <p>
          How <strong>real time pricing</strong> could contribute to mitigate market power?
          <ul>
            <li>Real time pricing would prevent <strong>extreme price spikes</strong>.</li>
            <li>It would also reduce the financial incentive of sellers to <strong>exercise market power</strong>, since one
              firm’s reduction of output would have a smaller effect on price than it does when demand
              is completely price-inelastic.</li>
            <li>The effect of real-time pricing also has very important implications for the <strong>negotiation of
                long-term contracts</strong>. If sellers, at the time of negotiation, believe that real-time pricing
                is likely, then they will reduce their forecasts of the average spot prices they would be able
                to earn if they did not sell through a long-term contract. As a result, the sellers will be
                willing to accept a lower long-term contract price than they otherwise would.</li>

      <h2>European electricity markets</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this section is to present some of the key aspects in the integration process of electricity markets in
        Europe. It also introduces two relevant elements in the design of electricity auctions: the design
        of transmission tariffs and the delineation of bidding zones.
      </p>
      <h4>Integration of electricity markets in Europe. The role of the system operator.</h4>
      <p>
        This section is based on the next document: European Commission, 2015, "Options for Future European Electricity System Operation." (Only the first 11th pages.)
        <br>
        <br>
        The European power sector is undergoing important changes. Especially the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES), as part of the transition to a de-carbonised power
        system, results in a need to continuously assess and decide upon (the adoption of) alternative
        technologies, policies and practices. We study the main points presented in European Commission (2015) to improve the design of electricity markets.
      </p>

          <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
            <p class="text-right">
              The main <strong>goals</strong> that should lead any proposed changes to <strong>system operations</strong> and <strong>planning</strong>:
              <ol>
                <li>Security of supply (secure for everybody)</li>
                <li>Market facilitation (affordable and competitive pricing)</li>
                <li>Integration of RES (environmentally sustainable).</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
          </div>

        <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
          <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
            <p class="text-right">
              The <strong>system planning and operations</strong> that should be taken into account in the new regulation scenario are the next ones:
              <ol>
                <li>Long-term network planning (years),</li>
                <li>System operation before real-time (months, day-ahead, intra-day),</li>
                <li>Real-time system operation (less than 15 minutes)</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

      <div class="boxa" style="background: #789091;">
        <p>            
          To facilitate the <strong>governance</strong> of the system operator in the integration of electricity markets
          in Europe, the European commission proposed the next parties which will assume different roles:
          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>European Commission</strong> to formulate general energy policy and directives</li>
            <li><strong>European regulatory body</strong> (current ACER) with the power to independently check
              the formulation and execution of methodologies, processes and procedures in line with the
              general policy</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Operation Centres</strong> (ROC) to execute prescribed tasks according to the formulated methodologies, 
              processes and procedures; responsible for execution</li>
            <li>European entity (current <strong>ENTSO-E</strong>) for development and implementation of methods
              and tools for LT planning and SO. In consultation with ACER (who sets up guidelines by
              request of the EC) this body develops the framework (e.g. grid codes) for execution of the
              tasks by ROCs and ensures overall alignment between them, and with national TSOs.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
          
      </div> 
      <div class="boxa">
        <p>
          According with the European Commission, the long-term planning and system operator before real time operations should 
          be centralized. The <strong>benefits from centralization</strong> are mainly related to:
          <ul>
            <li>Network planning,</li>
            <li>and system operations functions such as capacity calculation, congestion management,
              adequacy assessment and balancing.</li>

          <p>
            The European entity for the development and implementation of methods and tools (current
            ENTSO-E) is responsible for development of the way of working of the foreseen ROCs in line
            with guidelines and/ or regulation. This is then monitored and enforced by the regulatory body
            (current ACER).

  <!-- Tariffs -->
  <div class="container" style="display:block;">
    <h4>Transmission tariffs.</h4>
      <p>
          This section is based on the next documents:

          <ul>
            <li>ENTSO-E, 2016, "ENTSO-E ITC Overview of Transmission Tariffs in Europe: Synthesis 2014."
              (Only the first 21st pages).</li>
            <li>Nord Pool, 2007, "TSO Congestion Rent. How to Calculate the Congestion Rents."</li>
            <li>Nord Pool, 2010, "Point Tariff System."</li>
          </ul>          
        In the presence of transmission constraints the equilibrium prices differ across markets generating 
        <strong>congestion rents</strong>. In a <strong>perfect competition scenario</strong>, 
        the congestion rents are
        enough to finance the investments in transmission capacity. However, in the presence of <strong>uncertainty</strong> 
        or <strong>lumpy investments</strong> it is necessary to introduce tariffs to finance the investments in transmission capacity.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the majority of the European countries, the tariff structure is based on a <strong>point of connection tariff</strong> system (ENTSO-E, 2016; Nord Pool, 2010). 
        The <strong>users of the grid</strong> are charged
        for injection or outtake of electricity at a connection point in the transmission grid. The point
        of connection tariff consists of two parts, a <strong>power charge</strong> and an <strong>energy charge</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The <strong>power charge</strong> covers costs for expansion, operation and maintenance of the transmission grid. 
        It is based on annual capacity subscription for injection and outtake of electricity at
        each connection point. The cost the subscriber has to pay is the product of the annual capacity
        subscription and the power charge in the connection point.
        <br>
        <br>
        The <strong>energy charge</strong> is based on the transmission losses in the transmission grid caused by
        injection and outtake of electricity in different connection points. It is dependent on how the
        generation or load are distributed in the grid.
        <br>
        <br>
        The power charge and the energy charge have a <strong>geographical</strong> (latitude, north/south) and a
        time component (day/night, winter/spring, peak/off-peak) that provide a long-term locational
        signal on where it is optimal to add generation and load capacity from a grid perspective.

    <h4>Bidding zones.</h4>
      <p>
          This section is based on the next document:
          <ul>
            <li>Ofgem, 2014, "Bidding Zones Literature Review."</li>
          </ul>          
          A bidding zone is the largest geographical area within which market participants are able to
          <strong>exchange energy without capacity allocation</strong>.

    <div class="boxa" style="background: #5A758C;">
        <p>
          Bidding zones in Europe are currently defined according to differing <strong>criteria</strong> (figure Bidding Zones in Europe).
          <ul>
            <li>The majority are defined by national borders (eg, France or the Netherlands);</li>
            <li>however, some are larger than national borders (eg, Austria, Germany and Luxembourg or
              the Single Electricity Market for the island of Ireland)</li>
            <li>and some are smaller zones within individual countries (eg, Italy, Norway or Sweden).</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>How bidding zones can be delineated?</strong> Delineating bidding zones according to the location
          of network constraints may be undertaken in a number of ways.
          <ul>
            <li>Nodal pricing: The equilibrium price across markets differs when the transmission line is
              congested.</li>
            <li>Zonal pricing: The equilibrium price across markets is the same even when the transmission
              line is congested.</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Why does bidding zone configuration matter?</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>An optimal delineation of bidding zones should promote robust price signals for <strong>efficient
              short-term utilisation</strong></li>
            <li>and <strong>long-term development</strong> of the power system,</li>
            <li>whilst at the same time <strong>limiting system costs</strong>, including balancing costs and re-dispatch
              actions undertaken by TSOs.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
    </div>               
  </div> 

  <div class="container" style="display:block;">
    <p>
      The delineation of bidding zones has important impacts on <strong>market efficiency, liquidity</strong>,
      issues with <strong>market power, investment signals</strong> for new generation, <strong>distributional</strong> impacts
      and the cross border <strong>flows</strong>. We analyse one by one those impacts.

          <p class="text-right">
            <strong>Impact on efficient use of the network</strong>. The configuration of bidding zones has important implications for system operation, providing short run signals to users of the
            network that impact on the utilisation of available capacity and ultimately the overall efficiency of the system. These short run signals also have a long-term impact, influencing
            the long-term investment decisions of market players.
            <ul>
              <li>Delineating bidding zones according to network constraints would allow these constraints to be managed by capacity allocation rather than re-dispatch (ie, ex- post
                modifications of generation schedules undertaken by the SO), <strong>lowering constraint
                management costs for the SO</strong>.</li>
              <li>In export-constrained regions, the average wholesale price of electricity is likely to
                fall. Conversely, the average wholesale price of electricity is likely to rise in those
                areas at the other side of the constraint, where demand is higher. There is therefore
                a <strong>distributional impact</strong> to be considered through any reconfiguration of bidding
                zones.</li>

            <strong>Impact on market liquidity and hedging</strong>. The conventionally perceived impact on
            market liquidity arising from the configuration of bidding zones is that of <strong>falling levels
            of liquidity as the number of zones increases</strong>. This is a direct result of the smaller
            size of the markets, with fewer market players and as such a lower level of churn.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Lower liquidity consequences</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Lower liquidity could mean a less clear indication of the <strong>future value of power</strong> from
                the market, which adds a layer of risk which could lead to inefficient investment, or
                efficient investment not taking place.</li>
              <li>A fall in liquidity could also mean an increase in the <strong>cost of risk</strong>, due to lack of
                trading partners; this could well have a knock on effect on investment.</li>

            <strong>Impact on investment</strong>. The configuration of bidding zones is crucial to provide long-run
            signals that may affect investment decisions. The more the bidding zones configuration reflects the physical network constraints, 
            the greater the efficiency of the price signals for
            cross-zonal network development and the price signals for generation and load investments.

            <ul>
              <li>Fewer, larger bidding zones imply a large number of market players in any market

            <strong>Impact on cross-border flows</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>If bidding zones are not delineated according to network constraints, there is an inherent

              <li>Prices in zones that are delineated according to network congestions are more reflective

      <h2>Distribution electricity markets. NODES company business model</h2>
      <p>
        In this section we study the role that companies like NODES has on the design of distribution electricity markets. 
        We start analyzing some use cases in that company, then, we study the market design implemented by NODES.
      </p>
      <h4>Use Cases</h4>
      <p>
        Below, we study to use cases implemented by NODES to understand the market design and the business model of the company.

          <h5 style="text-align:center;">Use Case 1: NorFlex project demonstrate integration to Statnett’s mFRR market</h5>
          <p>
            This transaction is the first of its kind, pioneered within the NorFlex pilot project, where flexibility offered 
            from industrial, commercial buildings or households can be bought by both local grid companies and Statnett as a 
            result of the coordination between the two marketplaces. The first trade resulted in activation of flexibility from greenhouses.
            <br>
            <br>
            «Statnett has in a previous pilot project (eFleks) tested flexibility, where the aggregators have participated 
            directly in the TSOs balancing markets. What is new in the NorFlex project, is that we are testing how a local 
            flexibility market can be offered to both local grid companies and Statnett’s balancing markets, simultaneously. 
            This has never been tested before and can contribute to increased liquidity in markets and the customers’ ability 
            to make money» Says Pasi Norrbacka, Project manager for NorFlex at Statnett.
            <br>
            <br>
            «To avoid bottlenecks in the grid, households and commercial companies can be paid to reduce their consumption, for 
            example by switching off EV charging, boilers and other consumptions in a short period. The local grid companies Agder 
            Energi Nett and Glitre Energi has tested this with flexibility from greenhouses, schools and nurseries by using different 
            types of technology» says Inger Ose, NorFlex project manager at Agder Energi.
            <br>
            <br>
            An important part of the project is to demonstrate how aggregation, trading and activation of flexibility can be done in an 
            automated process. This important to Statnett, who are not set up to manage small bid volumes. Statnett uses electronic processes 
            (e-bestill) when the bids are activated, and NODES are forwarding these activation signals.

          <p>
            Building on the success of its current procurement of flexibility services, Western Power Distribution has launched IntraFlex, 
            a new innovation project with NODES and Smart Grid Consultancy.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Network Innovation Allowance funded project will look to deploy the NODES platform in the UK and create new, closer 
            to real time, flexibility market for the Distribution Network Operator. This will allow for providers to offer 
            flexibility in the day-ahead and intra-day timeframes with a number of features developed to ensure that any 
            actions do not create imbalance in the wider electricity market.
            <br>
            <br>
            Operating closer to real time should allow new participants to access the markets whilst key features such as a day 
            ahead information services as well as an auto-rebalancing function to the intra-day market will look to lower supplier 
            exposure to imbalance costs and decrease the costs of providing flexibility in the long run.
            <br>
            <br>
            The project will utilise a market platform designed and operated by NODES. This has been piloted in other European 
            trial and will be extended by NODES as part of the project to add imbalance mitigation features.
            <br>
            <br>
            The trial start with stakeholder engagement aimed at validating the market design and ensuring its value to the UK 
            electricity system “This trial will help us to better understand the impact that calling flexibility will have on 
            energy suppliers when we establish a flexibility market that operates close to real-time.  Utilising the NODES 
            platform will allow for new flexibility providers to offer their services confidently in the market” says Ben Godfrey,

    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>
      <strong>E-mobility in Norway.</strong>
      Norway is the frontrunner in terms of EV adoption, 
      boasting a sixty five percent market share of new-sales in 2022.
      <br>
      <br>
      Private Charging Point Operators (CPOs) were invited to 
      bid for both construction and operation of the charging 
      infrastructure. Today Norway has a network of fast 
      chargers on the major corridors. The public fast (50kW) 
      and ultrafast (>150kW) charging points are accessible 24 
      /7 and open to all types of EVs. In addition to CPOs 
      developing fast chargers, other companies are developing 
      AC charging at home and building complexes. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Smart EV charging.</strong>
      New innovative technology enables Electric Vehicles (EV) charging to 
      become smarter. Remote monitoring and activation of 
      charging enable new business models to develop. This 
      creates value to the customers that are willing to make 
      upwards or downwards adjustments in their consumption.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>E-mobility impact on grid congestions.</strong>
      The uptake of EVs is growing rapidly, resulting in an
      associated charging infrastructure being rolled out. As the 
      number of EVs increases, so does the electricity grid load 
      and the potential need for grid reinforcement. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Charging EVs might represent a problem for the grid.
      Either when uncoordinated charging is started based on 
      consumer behaviours from multiple chargers or started 
      because of a coordinated charging process optimised on 
      energy price alone. Smart charging represents both a 
      challenge and an opportunity for the Distribution System Operator (DSO) in this respect.
    </p>
    <h5>Market-based approach</h5>
    <p>
      Sellers place sales bids of flexibility on NODES based on 
      portfolios with one or more assets. Portfolios can be offered in the order book located at the lowest level of the 
      grid and will be visible through linked order books on 
      NODES. Each bid needs to have an associated baseline 
      which will be locked in the event of a matched trade. The 
      seller then provides meter data to the project’s Asset Hub
      at a minimum of 2 hours before and 2 hours after the 
      activated period.
    </p>
    <h5>Aggregating domestic flexibility from E-mobility.</h5>
    <p>
      Tibber is an energy company mainly focused on residential 
      customers. Tibber interacts with its customers via its app. 
      When a person downloads the app and becomes a 
      customer, they can pair electric appliances to the Tibber 
      app. Smart Charging guarantees the customer a discount
      for their EV charging cost in exchange for letting Tibber 
      control the device, always complying with the constraints 
      previously defined in the app by the customer.
      <br><br>
      To be able to offer the price reduction, Tibber actively uses
      arbitraging of the energy prices, either spot price or 
      intraday asset back trading; or by using the assets in
      flexibility markets, which can be provided to the TSO or 
      DSO.
    </p>
    <h5>Results</h5>
    <p>
      <strong>Modelling the congestion areas/order books.</strong>

      Building up the value chain and business models has been 
      done by defining an area of the distribution grid where 
      flexibility from various sources, levels, and providers has 
      been incentivised through an open tender process. Flexible Services Provideres (FSPs) 
      were invited to define and develop a business model using 
      the market design of the flexibility market platform where 
      the DSO and the TSO were the participants for utilising 
      local aggregated flexibility. The pilot area is defined by the 
      regional distribution grid transformers modelled in a DSO 
      tool (GridTools) for assessing, optimising, and trading 
      flexible resources through an API to the NODES market 
      platform.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Tibber reflections.</strong>

      Forecasting load on a portfolio level for baselines has been 
      a very difficult challenge to solve, considering the size of 
      each fleet and the randomness of customer behaviour.
      When it comes to trading, algorithmic automated trading 
      was developed for the project, which would need to be 
      further developed as market liquidity increases.
      <br><br>
      In Norflex, meter data is reported to AssetHub. AssetHub 
      is a platform developed by the DSO. Tibber believes that 
      this is not a scalable solution, considering that there are 
      hundreds of DSOs in Europe. Developing a custom 
      solution for each market would limit the expansion of 
      aggregators and impair the use of those assets. An ideal 
      solution would be to have one platform at a country level.
    </p>
    <h5>Conclusions</h5>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>This paper has described how smart charging of EVs in 
          Norway can stimulate the use of EV flexibility to offer new 
          services for solving congestion management in distributed 
          grids via a new marketplace, NODES.</li>
          <br>
        <li>While some market barriers have already been solved, 
          others still require attention. There is still a need for more 
          testing of baseline methodologies for congestion 
          management and testing of independent aggregation.</li>
          <br>
        <li>Smart and flexible solutions are required in order to 
          facilitate a cost-effective development of the power 
          system. Electric transport is one of the options that have
          the potential to start playing a key role in developing a 
          smart network.</li>
          <br>
        <li>During the NorFlex project, real trading has been 
          successfully demonstrated with both the sellers and buyers 
          posting bids in the market. NODES market has matched, 
          validated, and settled these trades. From Jan 1 2021 to Jan 
          31 2022, a total of 318 MWh has been traded for activation 
          (ShortFlex) as a result of 12 618 trades at a volume
          weighted average price of NOK 8 381,00 per MWh. The 
          lowest traded volume was 0,001MWh, and the largest 
          traded volume was 5 MWh (NODES Market Data, 2022).</li>
