                      <p class="mb-1">
                          The Sustainable Business Model course aims to connect the most salient topics in <strong>green economy</strong> with <strong>digitalization</strong>.
                          </br>
                          </br>
                          To achieve that objective, during the course the students analyze relevant topic in <strong>green economy</strong>, they build an <strong>economic model</strong> to study that topic and they develop an <strong>app</strong> to conduct all the economic simulations in the economic model.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                          To develop the app, the course is organized in three blocks that complement each other. First the students design the <strong>layout of the app</strong> by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Flask. Second, they program the <strong>economic simulations</strong> by using Python and SQLAlchemy. Finally, they <strong>deploy their apps</strong> in the server, by using GitGub, Heroku, and Amazon Web Services.

              <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>The assignment of the course consists on two parts.
              <br>
              <br>
              First, the students have to write an essay of <strong>5 pages</strong> with the methodology
              used to work out the transport carbon emissions. This part of the course counts for the 30% of the final grade.
              <br>
              <br>
              The objective of this part of the course is that you know the basic methodology to work out transport carbon
              emissions for cars, buses, boats, planes, motorbikes. I would like that the students provide some basic
              information about the carbon emissions of those means of conveyance. The students can fine-tune their
              methodology by differentiating among fuel types: diesel, electric. 
              An introduction to frame the discussion, and an example to give some numerical analysis could be also useful.
              For example, a comparison of the carbon emissions between Bergen and Oslo depending on the means of
              conveyance can be useful and illustrative.
              <br>
              <br>
              The methodology could be fine-tuned in different respects. For example, by differentiating between
              types of hydrogen used in transport: brown, grey, blue or green. By differentiating the types of bioenergy,
              or the source of electricity to charge electric batteries. The methodology could also be fine-tuned by considering
              life cycle of batteries, and the means of conveyance. However, I do not want the students go in that direction.
              The students will have the opportunity to go deeper and further in their analysis in their 20 pages project, since
              that is the topic that the students consider interesting for them.
              <br>
              <br>
              Second, the students have to write an essay of <strong>20 pages</strong> on a topic that they choose related to the content of
              the course. The students also have to present this research in the conference organized at the end of the course.
              This part of the course counts for the 70% of the final grade. This part of the course will be evaluated by me, and
              Elisa Trujillo from University of Lleida.
              <br>
              <br>
              The objective of this part of the course is that you choose a topic that interest you, and that you write 20
              pages about it. The way in which you address that topic depends on you. You can write a survey, a
              theoretical, an empirical, or an operation research paper. That depends on your preferences. It is
              important that the style of the paper suits the methodology that you choose. It is also important that
              the style fits the 20 pages objective. Most of the students tend to use the structure of a 100 pages
              master thesis even when I ask them to write 20 pages. The objective of this part of the course is
              that you learn to write different types of documents, with different length and different styles.
              <br>
              <br>
              The app developed by the students does not account for the final grade.
              <br>
              <br>
              The students have to write a one page summary of their final essay to be published in the newsletter of the course, but
              that part does not account for the final grade.

              <br>
              The essay in the topic chosen by the students is conducted in groups of six persons. These groups can be formed
              by the students as they want. I suggest the students to form balanced groups by gender, nationality.

              second part of the lecture, we add some more lines of code ot our app. We conclude each lecture by pushing our app to the server, and the students

              <br>
              The code for each lecture will be available in a Github account, so the students can have access to that code and they will be sure that their app run

                  We can set an appointment on Fridays from 10:00 to 12:00 by using Zoom (https://nhh.zoom.us/j/6343089435).

                  <br>
                  If you cannot meet on Fridays at that time, please drop me a line, and we set an appointment at a different time.
